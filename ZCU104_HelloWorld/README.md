## ZCU104 Hello World 

This program is designed to show basic input and output control using 
an FPGA. The FPGA is programmed to control an LED at 4 frequencies 
- 1Hz, 4Hz, 10Hz, and 16Hz. One dip switch enables LED ouput and two 
more create a binary frequency selector. 

This program was used as a 'all systems functional' test before the 
main material was writ to the FPGA.
